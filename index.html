      <h1 class="type2">Choosing a statistical test</h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="#test-choice">diagram below</a> is intended as a guide to choosing an appropriate statistical
        test to investigate the relationship between two or more variables for a given
        dataset. It focuses on determining what type of test is available based on the
        nature of the data. Answering the questions about the dependent and independent
        variables will guide you to a specific test or method to use. It is important to
        note that in most cases more than one option is available. To help simplify
        decision making only a single choice is provided here.

        <h3>Dependent and independent variables</h3>
        <p>
          The diagram asks you to make choices based on the nature of <em>dependent</em>
          and <em>independent</em> variables. In many situations that distinction is clear.
          If you are interested in testing how different experimental conditions change
          an outcome measure of interest, it is pretty clear that the outcome measure is
          the dependent variable and all other variables will be treated as independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things aren't always that clear cut. Especially in situations where you are dealing
          with two variables it is possible that there is no clear distinction between them.
          For example, if you are interested in how closely related two different outcome
          measures are, neither of them really is an independent variable. For the purpose
          of the below diagram you are free to choose either one as dependent variable.
          Note, however, that if the two variables are of different type, the statistical
          analysis methods at your disposal will differ depending on which one you treat as
          independent variable.
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement scales</h3>
        <p>
          While traversing the diagram you will be asked to indicate the level at which your
          dependent and independent variables are measured. These questions rely on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement" target="_blank">
            Stevens' classsification of measurement scales</a>. This classsification
          system recognises four types of measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nominal</strong> measures distinguish between a fixed number of discrete classes
          that are identified by their names. No numeric value is attached to the different
          classes and they can only be compared for equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ordinal</strong> measures consist of discrete categories that can be ranked. This
          allows for comparison of values to determine whether one of them is larger than the
          other but the magnitude of the difference between two observations is not meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interval</strong> measures are numeric quantities for which differences can be computed
          and compared in a meaningful way. However, such scales do not include a <em>zero</em>
          point that corresponds to an absence of the measured quantity. As a result of this
          ratios of interval measures are not meaningful, so it isn't possible to say that one
          value is twice as large as another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ratio</strong> scale measurements are numeric quantities that <em>do</em> include a
          meaningful <em>zero</em> and allow for ratios between them to be computed and compared.
        </p>
        <h3>Multivariate responses</h3>
        <p>
          You may have more than one response measure. It may be perfectly fine to analyse
          each of these separately. If that is what you want to do, simply use the diagram
          below repeatedly, using each measure as dependent variable in turn. It may be
          beneficial to consider a joint analysis of your measures, treating them as a single
          multivariate response. This situation is not covered here.
