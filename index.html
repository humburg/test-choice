      <h1 class="type2">Choosing a statistical test</h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="#test-choice">diagram below</a> is intended as a guide to choosing an appropriate statistical
        test to investigate the relationship between two or more variables for a given
        dataset. It focuses on determining what type of test is available based on the
        nature of the data. Answering the questions about the dependent and independent
        variables will guide you to a specific test or method to use. It is important to
        note that in most cases more than one option is available. To help simplify
        decision making only a single choice is provided here.

        <h3>Dependent and independent variables</h3>
        <p>
          The diagram asks you to make choices based on the nature of <em>dependent</em>
          and <em>independent</em> variables. In many situations that distinction is clear.
          If you are interested in testing how different experimental conditions change
          an outcome measure of interest, it is pretty clear that the outcome measure is
          the dependent variable and all other variables will be treated as independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things aren't always that clear cut. Especially in situations where you are dealing
          with two variables it is possible that there is no clear distinction between them.
          For example, if you are interested in how closely related two different outcome
          measures are, neither of them really is an independent variable. For the purpose
          of the below diagram you are free to choose either one as dependent variable.
          Note, however, that if the two variables are of different type, the statistical
          analysis methods at your disposal will differ depending on which one you treat as
          independent variable.
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement scales</h3>
        <p>
          While traversing the diagram you will be asked to indicate the level at which your
          dependent and independent variables are measured. These questions rely on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement" target="_blank">
            Stevens' classification of measurement scales</a>. This classification
          system recognises four types of measurements, <em>nominal</em>, <em>ordinal</em>,
          <em>interval</em>, and <em>ratio</em> scales.
        </p>
        <h4>Types of scales</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Nominal</strong> measures distinguish between a fixed number of discrete classes
          that are identified by their names. No numeric value is attached to the different
          classes and they can only be compared for equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ordinal</strong> measures consist of discrete categories that can be ranked. This
          allows for comparison of values to determine whether one of them is larger than the
          other but the magnitude of the difference between two observations is not meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interval</strong> measures are numeric quantities for which differences can be computed
          and compared in a meaningful way. However, such scales do not include a <em>zero</em>
          point that corresponds to an absence of the measured quantity. As a result of this
          ratios of interval measures are not meaningful, so it isn't possible to say that one
          value is twice as large as another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ratio</strong> scale measurements are numeric quantities that <em>do</em> include a
          meaningful <em>zero</em> and allow for ratios between values them to be computed and compared.
        </p>
        <h4>Using different types of scales</h4>
        <p>
          Looking at the above description you may note that these measurement scales fall into two
          groups. <em>Nominal</em> and <em>ordinal</em> variables take on values from a limited
          number of categories and may be described as <em>categorical</em> variables. Methods that
          indicate that they require nominal measurements will generally also work for ordinal data,
          although any ordering of values will be ignored. Similarly, <em>interval</em> and <em>ratio</em>
          scales can collectively be described as being <em>numeric</em>. Methods designed for
          interval scale variables will also work for ratio scale measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some situations it is common practice to treat measures that really are <em>ordinal</em>
          as if they were <em>interval</em> values. For example, Likert scale items are generally
          ordinal. However, it is common to aggregate individual items into scales by adding or averaging
          individual items, thereby treating them as if they were on an <em>interval</em> scale. The resulting
          aggregate scores are then typically treated as <em>interval</em> measurements. If the underlying
          assumption that a single step increase for each item corresponds to a unit change of
          the measured construct is reasonable, this approach is justified.
        </p>
        <h3>What you won't find here</h3>
        <p>
          The methods covered here are by no means exhaustive. The focus on choosing
          a test procedure based on the properties of the data means that little consideration
          is given to specific research questions or common practices in a given field
          of research. The recommended methods are of general utility and appropriate
          under the indicated conditions. However, it is entirely possible that a better
          method exists for your specific study. Below are a few notes on methods and
          circumstances not covered here.
        </p>
        <h4>Multivariate responses</h4>
        <p>
          You may have more than one response measure. If these measures are largely independent
          of each other it is perfectly fine to analyse them separately. If that is what you want to do,
          simply use the diagram below repeatedly, using each measure as dependent variable in turn. It may,
          however, be beneficial to consider a joint analysis of your measures, treating them as a single
          multivariate response. This situation is not covered here.
        </p>
        <h4>Structural Equation Models</h4>
        <p>
          Structural equation models (SEMs) are not included in the diagram below.
          They combine factor analysis and multiple regression techniques
          to model structural relationships between observed and latent variables. When combined with
          longitudinal data SEMs, unlike the methods covered here, can be used to model causal relationships
          but care needs to be taken in the interpretation of such models. Even carefully designed
          experiments can usually not rule out all alternative interpretations, leaving some doubts
          regarding causality.
        </p>
        <h4>Time series</h4>
        <p>
          Time series consist of regular measurements taken over an extended period of time. Their
          analysis usually focuses on the identification of short term, long term and seasonal
          trends. Although they share some common features with longitudinal data (which may be
          analysed with some of the methods below), time series focus on the detailed analysis
          of single units based on frequent observations whereas longitudinal studies track
          changes in populations, often using relatively few timepoints per individual.
